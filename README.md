## ✨ Features

- **Prime Number Verification**: Determines whether a number is prime.
- **Twin Prime Pairs**: Finds pairs of twin prime numbers.
- **Palindromic Primes**: Identifies prime numbers that are also palindromes.
- **Interactivity**: The program allows users to interact with each exercise and efficiently obtain results.

## 🗂️ Data Structure

This project does not use complex data structures, as it mainly focuses on the execution of mathematical algorithms to solve the described problems.

## 📄 Project Modules (Files)

The project has the following file structure:

- **`main.py`**: Main file that runs the program and manages the exercise options.
- **`es_primo.py`**: Contains the logic to determine if a number is prime.
- **`pares_primos_gemelos.py`**: Implements the search for twin prime pairs.
- **`primos_palindromicos.py`**: Solves the problem of finding prime numbers that are also palindromes.
- **`utilidades_menu.py`**: Provides utility functions to display menus and handle user interactions.

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jharmo05/Primos-gemelos-y-palindromicos.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Primos-gemelos-y-palindromicos
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📝 Usage

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - Find twin primes
   - Find palindromic primes
3. Enter the requested number range to perform the search.
4. Exit the program by selecting option **3** from the menu.
